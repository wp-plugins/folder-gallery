This plugin generates picture galleries from a folder using a shortcode.

== Description ==

This plugin creates picture galleries from a folder. 
The pictures folder must be uploaded (using FTP) somewhere on the server (e.g. wp-content/upload). It must be writable (chmod 777).

Folder Gallery Plugin does not include any lightbox JS engine anymore. You have to install one or use a compatible lightbox plugin. See FAQ.

To include a gallery in a post or a page, you have to use the following shortcode :

	[foldergallery folder="local_path_to_folder" title="Gallery title"]

For each gallery, a subfolder cache_[width]x[height] is created inside the pictures folder when the page is accessed for the first time. 

An Options page allow to set the default paramaters of the galleries :

* Lightbox JS Engine: Lightbox 2 (if installed), Fancybox 2 (if installed), Lightview 3 (if installed), Easy Fancybox Plugin (if available), Responsive Lightbox Plugin (if available) or none (default)
* Display Thumbnails (thumbnails): all = standard Gallery, single = displays a single thumbnail linked to the lightbox gallery, none = displays a link to the lightbox gallery
* Sort pictures by (sort) : pictures are sorted by filename (filename) or in reverse order (filename_desc) or by modification date (date or date_desc) or randomly (random)
* Number of images per row (columns)
* Thumbnails width and height (width & height)
* Picture border (border)
* Padding and Margin (padding & margin)
* Caption Format (caption): default (title + picture number), filename, filenamewithoutextension, smartfilename (filename with underscores and front numbers removed), modificationdate, modificationdateandtime, modificationdater (RFC 2822), modificationdatec (ISO 8601), none
* Show Thumbnail Captions (show_thumbnail_captions): yes (true) or no (false). Display (or not) the caption under the picture thumbnail.
* Fancybox Caption Style: Inside, Outside, Over, Float, None. Available with Fancybox 2 engine only (if installed).
* Fancybox Transition: Elastic, Fade. Available with Fancybox 2 engine only (if installed).
* Autoplay Speed: Slideshow speed in seconds. 0 to turn autoplay off. Available with Fancybox 2 engine only (if installed).
* Misc settings - Permissions: force 777 permissions on cache folder. Leave it uncheck unless you really know what you do!
* Misc settings - Orientation: Correct picture orientation according to EXIF tag. Rotated pictures will be overwritten. (Require EXIF library in PHP.) Delete the cache folder to apply to existing galleries.
 
Most of theses settings can be overridden using the corresponding shortcode :

	[foldergallery folder="path" title="title" columns=1 width=150 
			height=90 border=1 padding=2 margin=10 thumbnails=single]

See http://projects.nickstakenburg.com/lightview/documentation for details about Lightview options.

= Can I use Folder Gallery along with another Lightbox plugin? =

Folder Gallery has built-in support for "Easy Fancybox" plugin by RavanH, "Responsive Lightbox" plugin by dFactory, and "Slenderbox" plugin by Matthew Petroff. After activating the plugin, select it in Folder Gallery Settings (Gallery Engine).

Otherwise, if your Lightbox plugin automatically handles images, you may set the lightbox engine to 'None' in Folder Gallery Options.
This should work with

* Fancybox 1.0.7+ by Kevin Sylvestre
* jQuery Colorbox 4.5+ by Arne Franken
* Lightview Plus 3.1.3+ by Puzich
* Maybe other

= Can I use Easy Fancybox plugin along with Folder Gallery? =

Yes! First install and activate Easy Fancybox plugin. In Wordpress > Settings > Media > Fancybox > Images > Gallery, Disabled Autogllery. Then, in Wordpress > Settings > Folder Gallery, select "Easy Fancybox (plugin)" as Gallery Engine.

= I'd like to display a single thumbnail instead of the full thumbnails list =

Add the attribute `thumbnails` in the shortcode with value `single` to display only the first thumbnail.

	[foldergallery folder="path" title="My Gallery" thumbnails="single"]

If you want to use a different picture (than the first) as the single thumbnail for the gallery, add a picture with name !!! (e.g., `!!!.jpg`) to your gallery. This picture will be used as thumbnail, but won't be included in the (lightbox) gallery. Another option is to use the shortcode attribute `thumbnails=-n` where `n`is the picture number (in the gallery) you want to use as single thumbnail. 

To hide gallery title under the thumbnail, add `title=""`. You then should set `caption' to something else than `default`, e.g., `caption="filename"`.

= I'd like to display only the n first thumbnails instead of the full thumbnails list =

Add the attribute `thumbnails` in the shortcode with value `n` to display only the n first thumbnails.

	[foldergallery folder="path" title="My Gallery" thumbnails=3]

= I'd like to display a (sub)title under each thumbnail =

You have to set show_thumbnail_captions to 1 (or change the global option in Folder Gallery Settings) using 

	[foldergallery folder="path" title="My Gallery" show_thumbnail_captions=true]

The caption format is set with the attribute `caption`. It can be set to `filename`, `filenamewithoutextension` or `smartfilename` which displays the filename without extension, front number removed and underscores (_) replaced with spaces.

	[foldergallery folder="path" title="My Gallery" show_thumbnail_captions=1 caption='smartfilename']
